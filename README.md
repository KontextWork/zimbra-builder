# WAT

Automation of the automation to build zimbra.

Simply uses [ianw1974/zimbra-build-scripts](ianw1974/zimbra-build-scripts) (all the credits to Ian!) to automate a build 
using github actions. 

Should be an easy starter to automate the builds for all of us. 

What it will be not:

- create patches for Zimbra of any sort (not the right repo)
- harm or violate Zimbra's Terms


## Usage

Either use the build artifacts (you should not IMHO), or clone this repo and do your own builds or whatever.

So just either see the builds under [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) and do what ever you like with it
